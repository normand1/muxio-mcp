# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is an MCP (Model Context Protocol) Hub server that acts as a proxy/aggregator for multiple MCP servers. It bypasses tool limitations in AI assistants (especially Cursor's 40-tool limit) and provides a unified interface to multiple MCP servers.

## Development Commands

### Build and Run
```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build TypeScript to JavaScript
pnpm build

# Run the server (after building)
pnpm start

# Build and run in one command
pnpm dev
```

### Development Workflow
```bash
# For testing changes locally with npx
npm link  # Creates a global link to the local package
npx muxio-mcp  # Test the linked version

# To unlink after testing
npm unlink -g muxio-mcp
```

### Release Process
- Uses semantic-release with Conventional Commits
- Commits should follow: `type(scope): description`
- Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, perf, test, chore
- Breaking changes: add `!` after type or `BREAKING CHANGE:` in body
- Releases are automated via GitHub Actions on the main branch

## Architecture

### Core Components

1. **src/index.ts** - Entry point that creates the MCP server with three tools:
   - `list-all-tools`: Lists all available tools from connected servers
   - `call-tool`: Executes a tool on a specific server
   - `find-tools`: Grep-like search for tools matching regex patterns

2. **src/server-manager.ts** - `McpServerManager` class that:
   - Loads server configurations from JSON file
   - Manages connections to multiple MCP servers
   - Proxies tool calls to appropriate servers
   - Handles server lifecycle and error recovery
   - Implements `findTools` method for regex-based tool search

3. **src/types.ts** - Type definitions and Zod schemas for:
   - Server configuration validation
   - MCP SDK type exports
   - Configuration file structure
   - Parameter schemas for all tools

### Configuration

The server configuration is loaded from (in order of precedence):
1. Environment variable: `MCP_CONFIG_PATH`
2. Command-line argument: `--config-path`
3. Default location: `./mcp-config.json` or `{cwd}/mcp-config.json`

Configuration format (Claude Desktop compatible):
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "server-name": {
      "command": "command-to-run",
      "args": ["arg1", "arg2"],
      "env": { "KEY": "value" }
    }
  }
}
```

### Tool Naming Convention

Tools from connected servers are prefixed with the server name:
- Original tool: `list-files`
- Through hub: `server-name__list-files`

## Important Considerations

1. **Error Handling**: The hub gracefully handles server connection failures and continues operating with available servers.

2. **Environment Variables**: Server configurations can include environment variables that are passed to child processes.

3. **Logging**: Uses console.error for error messages since stdout is reserved for MCP protocol communication.

4. **No Tests**: Currently no test framework is set up. When implementing tests, consider:
   - Unit tests for server-manager.ts logic
   - Integration tests for MCP protocol handling
   - Mock MCP server responses for testing

5. **TypeScript Configuration**: 
   - Target: ES2020
   - Module: NodeNext with NodeNext resolution
   - Strict mode enabled
   - Outputs to `dist/` directory
   - Declaration files generated

6. **Dependencies**: 
   - Keep dependencies minimal (currently only @modelcontextprotocol/sdk and zod)
   - All types are exported from types.ts for consistency

7. **Binary Execution**: Configured as npm binary `muxio-mcp` with shebang in index.ts
